# TODO List for Confidential Booking Feature

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyze the booking system to understand mentor selection logic
- [x] Review student and mentor registration to confirm college field storage
- [x] Modify _fetchCounsellors method in BookingPage to filter mentors by student's college
- [x] Update booking.dart to implement college-based mentor filtering

## Summary
The confidential booking feature has been successfully implemented. Now, when students access the booking page, only mentors from their same college will be listed in the mentor selection dropdown. This ensures privacy and relevance by limiting mentor options to those within the same educational institution.

## Next Steps
- Test the booking functionality to verify mentors are filtered correctly
- Consider adding error handling for cases where no mentors are available from the student's college
- Optionally, add a message to inform students if no mentors are available from their college
